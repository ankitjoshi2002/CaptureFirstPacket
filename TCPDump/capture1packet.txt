Task 1. Identify network interfaces
In this task, you must identify the network interfaces that can be used to capture network packet data.

Use ifconfig to identify the interfaces that are available:
sudo ifconfig
Copied!
This command returns output similar to the following:

eth0: flags=4163  mtu 1460
        inet 172.17.0.2  netmask 255.255.0.0  broadcast 172.17.255.255
        ether 02:42:ac:11:00:02  txqueuelen 0  (Ethernet)
        RX packets 784  bytes9379957 (8.9 MiB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 683  bytes 56880 (55.5 KiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0 collisions 0

lo: flags=73  mtu 65536
        inet 127.0.0.1  netmask 255.0.0.0
        loop  txqueuelen 1000  (Local Loopback)
        RX packets 400  bytes 42122 (041.1 KiB)
        RX errors 0  dropped 0  overruns 0  frame 0
        TX packets 400  bytes 42122 (041.1 KiB)
        TX errors 0  dropped 0 overruns 0  carrier 0 collisions 0
The Ethernet network interface is identified by the entry with the eth prefix.

So, in this lab, you'll use eth0 as the interface that you will capture network packet data from in the following tasks.

Use tcpdump to identify the interface options available for packet capture:
sudo tcpdump -D
Copied!
This command will also allow you to identify which network interfaces are available. This may be useful on systems that do not include the ifconfig command.


You have completed this task and used ifconfig and tcpdump to list the network interfaces in this machine.
