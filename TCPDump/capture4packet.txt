Task 4. Filter the captured packet data
In this task, use tcpdump to filter data from the packet capture file you saved previously.

Use the tcpdump command to filter the packet header data from the capture.pcap capture file:
sudo tcpdump -nn -r capture.pcap -v
Copied!
This command will run tcpdump with the following options:

-nn: Disable port and protocol name lookup.
-r: Read capture data from the named file.
-v: Display detailed packet data.
You must specify the -nn switch again here, as you want to make sure tcpdump does not perform name lookups of either IP addresses or ports, since this can alert threat actors.

This returns output data similar to the following:

reading from file capture.pcap, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet)
20:53:27.669101 IP (tos 0x0, ttl 64, id 50874, offset 0, flags [DF], proto TCP (6), length 60)
    172.17.0.2:46498 > 146.75.38.132:80: Flags [S], cksum 0x5445 (incorrect), seq 4197622953, win 65320, options [mss 1420,sackOK,TS val 610940466 ecr 0, nop,wscale 7], length 0
20:53:27.669422 IP (tos 0x0, ttl 62, id 0, offset 0, flags [DF], proto TCP (6), length 60)
    146.75.38.132:80: > 172.17.0.2:46498: Flags [S.], cksum 0xc272 (correct), seq 2026312556, ack 4197622953, win 65535, options [mss 1420,sackOK,TS val 155704241 ecr 610940466, nop,wscale 9], length 0
As in the previous example, you can see the IP packet information along with information about the data that the packet contains.

Use the tcpdump command to filter the extended packet data from the capture.pcap capture file:
sudo tcpdump -nn -r capture.pcap -X
Copied!
This command will run tcpdump with the following options:

-nn: Disable port and protocol name lookup.
-r: Read capture data from the named file.
-X: Display the hexadecimal and ASCII output format packet data. Security analysts can analyze hexadecimal and ASCII output to detect patterns or anomalies during malware analysis or forensic analysis.
Note: Hexadecimal, also known as hex or base 16, uses 16 symbols to represent values, including the digits 0-9 and letters A, B, C, D, E, and F. American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) is a character encoding standard that uses a set of characters to represent text in digital form.

Filter the captured packet data
Test your understanding
To test your ability to capture and view network data, answer the multiple-choice questions.


What command would you use to capture 3 packets on any interface with the verbose option?

sudo tcpdump -n3 -i any -v

sudo tcpdump -N2 -i any -v

sudo tcpdump -s3 -i all -v

sudo tcpdump -c3 -i any -v


What does the -i option indicate?

Incremental monitoring mode

The number of packets to capture

The network interface to monitor

Capture incoming packets only


What type of information does the -v option include?

Verbose information

Virtual packets

Packets including the letter `V`

Version information


What tcpdump command can you use to identify the interfaces that are available to perform a packet capture on?

sudo capture p.cap

sudo tcpdump -D

sudo ls

sudo tcpdump

Conclusion
Great work!

You have gained practical experience to enable you to

identify network interfaces,
use the tcpdump command to capture network data for inspection,
interpret the information that tcpdump outputs regarding a packet, and
save and load packet data for later analysis.
You’re well on your way to capturing your first packet.
